This is a simple authentication framework for [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/).  

It simply read and writes usernames, hashed passwords, and salts to a json file.

The goal is to handle user signups and logins in a safe and simple way.

If you want more than that, you should probably use something like [flask-login](https://github.com/maxcountryman/flask-login).

To see this code in action, just clone the repo and run serve.py.
